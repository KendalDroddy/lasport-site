# Team LaS'port

This website is a project that I'm completing for a local cycling team - Team LaS'port. It will serve primarily as a landing page for the team. The call to action will prompt users to be redirected to the team's Facebook page where they can then register to join the team or sign up for races. Given the function of the page, I've decided to use Bootstrap to aid in development. I will purpose it as a hero-style page, but with custom CSS to give it some more character. All photos on the site are my own as well, taken at last year's (2016) Rocky Mount criterium.
